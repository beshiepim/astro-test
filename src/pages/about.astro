    <h2>...and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>Currently working through Astro's intro tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself.</p>

    <p>I will keep updating this site as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking in to see how my journey is going.</p>
    
    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
  <li>I live in {identity.place} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
  {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
    <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
  }
</ul>

<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
  {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
</ul>

{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}
{goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
